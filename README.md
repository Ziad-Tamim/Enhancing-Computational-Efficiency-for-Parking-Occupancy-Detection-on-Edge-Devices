![Screenshot 2024-10-09 231151](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e31819-f5e0-4c00-8eb8-787a4f490005)


## Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of parking occupancy detection in urban environments by leveraging deep learning models optimized for edge devices. The system is built using a custom deep learning model called QCustom, based on MobileNetV1 architecture, designed specifically for real-time parking classification on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi. By implementing model compression techniques, this project achieves high accuracy and fast inference speeds, making it suitable for practical deployment in smart parking systems.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an edge-based deep learning model for real-time parking occupancy classification.
- Optimize the model using compression techniques (knowledge distillation and quantization).
- Test the system's performance on both a prototype parking lot and real-world video data.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three datasets for training and testing the parking occupancy classification model:

1. CNRPark-EXT: A comprehensive dataset with 144,965 labeled images of parking spaces captured under various conditions.
2. Prototype Parking Lot Dataset: Created using a controlled setup with toy cars and a parking mat to simulate real-world conditions. This dataset helps refine the model for edge-based implementation.
3. Hyderabad Dataset: An open-air parking lot dataset that includes night-time images, allowing the model to handle diverse lighting scenarios.

|-----------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| CNRPark-EXT           | 79,307          | 65,658        | 144,965       |
| Prototype Dataset     | 119             | 292           | 411           |

- Depthwise Separable Convolutions: Used to create a lightweight architecture that performs spatial filtering and feature combining with minimal computational overhead.
- Compression Techniques: Knowledge distillation and quantization reduce model size, enabling deployment on resource-limited devices.

### Code Structure
- Data Preprocessing: Analyse and organization of dataset images to create labeled data for training.
- Model Training: Custom model is trained using TensorFlow with knowledge distillation from a larger teacher (ResNet50) model and quantized using TensorFlow Lite.
- Occupancy Detection Algorithm: Processes real-time video frames on a Raspberry Pi to detect parking occupancy in designated slots.
- Data Transmission: Sends occupancy data from the Raspberry Pi to a centralized system for data aggregation and visualization.
- User Interface: Hosts a local web server using Flask, allowing users to view real-time parking lot occupancy status.

### System Design
The system is composed of three layers:

1. Sensor Layer: Captures video frames and processes occupancy data on the edge device.
2. Centralized System Layer: Aggregates data from multiple sensors.
3. User Interface Layer: Displays real-time parking occupancy status through a web interface.
